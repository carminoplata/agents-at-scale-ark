# Using the ARK CLI

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @agents-at-scale/ark
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Enable tab completion (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(ark completion bash)"      # For bash
eval "$(ark completion zsh)"       # For zsh

# Install ark - or install and wait for it to be ready.
ark install
ark install -y --wait-for-ready=5m  # chooses 'yes' for each option

# Show ark status.
ark status

# Start interactive chat
ark chat

# Chat with a specific target
ark chat agent/math

# Show current config.
ark config

# Uninstall ark.
ark uninstall
```

Then query any agent:

```
> @weather What's the weather today?
> @math Calculate 15 * 23
```

That's it! The CLI maintains conversation context and lets you interact with any deployed ARK agents.

## Marketplace

The ARK CLI supports dynamic marketplace service enumeration from a `marketplace.json` file hosted in the marketplace repository.

```bash
# List available marketplace services and agents
ark marketplace list

# Install a marketplace service
ark install marketplace/services/<service-name>

# Install a marketplace agent
ark install marketplace/agents/<agent-name>

# Uninstall a marketplace service or agent
ark uninstall marketplace/services/<service-name>
ark uninstall marketplace/agents/<agent-name>
```

The marketplace fetches services and agents from `https://github.com/mckinsey/agents-at-scale-marketplace/raw/main/marketplace.json` using the Anthropic Marketplace JSON format. If the fetch fails, an unavailable message is displayed.

## Local Development

```bash
# Navigate to the CLI source
cd tools/ark-cli

# Create global symlink
npm link --force

# Run directly or with live reload
ark         # Run the CLI
npm run dev # Or run with live reload
```

Changes to the source code will instantly reflect when you run `ark` commands.
